This microservice is run a GCP Cloud Engine VM. The VM is triggered every Thursday by a Pub/Sub event and saves the results in Bigquery Table.
<p>
</p>
After having created <a href="https://github.com/nichohelmut/bookie_clustering_ms">archetype groups</a> , we will use the percentual affiliation of the teams belonging to these groups, as features to train the XGBoost model.
<p>
</p>
Besides the AA, we will see more feature engineering. We will calculate the average goal difference for home and away teams for the last 4 games (home or away).
Then we are going to append the results from the last three matches per team (win, draw or loss) as columns/features to the data frame.
<p>
</p>
We will also append the absolute home or away team goal difference and the average home or away team goal difference from the last two games to the data frame.
